# Bounce

Bounce is an interactive music sequencing application. Start with a preloaded "scene" or reset it and make your own.

Click "Create Block" then choose two points on the grid to make a new block. Blocks add a boundary that prevents the balls from passing through.

Click "Create Ball" then set the parameters below, to control the ball's movement and the sound it creates. Click anywhere on the grid to set the ball in motion.

The grid is designed to allow you to arrange your music in 4/4 time. You can create a composition in a different time signature by shrinking the grid using blocks.

Bounce was built using Javascript and the P5 library.
